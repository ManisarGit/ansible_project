Setting Up Application Environment using Ansible 

Whenever a new server is launched, the developers have to manually log in to the server and configure the application environment and deploy the application. This approach is time-consuming. We would automate the tasks with the help of configuration management tool Ansible.

We are going to create a playbook where we'll configure the application environment and deploy the application. Developers have provided instructions in a file regarding building and deploying the application.
